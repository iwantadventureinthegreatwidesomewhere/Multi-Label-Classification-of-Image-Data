#### COMP 551 - Mini-Project #3

## IMPORTANT:
Before running all of the cells, please make sure to leave "extra" to False as it loads the extra MNIST dataset for a larger training dataset.
Also leave all "dont_run" to True as those will force to not run all the hyper parameter search cells.

Please also make sure that the "MNIST_synthetic.h5" is exported form the zip and is located in the same folder as the ".ipynb" file.

- pandas (0.25.1)
